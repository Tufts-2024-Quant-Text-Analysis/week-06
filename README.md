# Week 6 - Text Classification and Logistic Regression

## Files overview

- [tei/](./tei/): A directory containing all of the TEI files for Greek tragedy in English translation. The relevant lines have been prepocessed and pickled for class, but in case you want to access the raw data for your own work, you can find almost everything here.
- Note that I have excluded Sophocles' _Ichneutae_ and Euripides' _Cyclops_ and (somewhat controversially) _Alcestis_, as these are not, strictly speaking, tragedies.
- Note too that in case of multiple versions available from [PerseusDL](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit), I have only kept the most recent one.
